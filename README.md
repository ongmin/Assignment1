#Key learnings
- In order to circumvent the issue of clearing canvases, I first tried seperating the monster and coins on different canvas&context, but this will later pose a problem when I try to interact them. Thus we're back on the same canvas.

- In terms of efficiency in creating and completing a project, focus on creating rough elements and focus on the behaviours of your objects. Then allocate the remaining time to the styling.

- Formatting of object oriented programming in javascript

- (to be updated)
